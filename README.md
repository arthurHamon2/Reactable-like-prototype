Reactable-like prototype
========================

About the project
-----------------

I did this project with my teammate, Thomas Betous, during my internship at Teesside University in 2011.  
The main purpose was to create a project similar to the reactable (http://www.reactable.com/), but on a horizontal smartBoard.
We spent a few months on this and we ended up with a prototype. We did not implemented all the functionalities of the reactable project 
but at least the basic ones.

Functionnalities
----------------

* _Placing reactable objects on the canvas_

    From a list menu, you can drag the reactable objects on the canvas. 
The objects on the canvas are connecting with others according to their distance.

* _Oscillator implementation_

    We implemented an oscillator, we can change the frequence turning the object, the wave type and the volume.

* _Music sampler implementation_

    A simple music sampler was implemented, you can choose, from a list, the music you would like to play and its volume.

__To see the prototype in action, you should check our video below.__

How to use the project
----------------------

This is a C# project, so you should run it with Microsoft Visual Studio (just launch the project file "Reactable-likeInterfacePrototype1.sln").
Running this prototype without a SmartBoard will not provide all the functionnalities even if some should work on desktop. 
To really enjoy the prototype, you should run it on a SmartBoard otherwise take a look at our project video below.
